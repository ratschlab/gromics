Build a junction database 

step 1 - collect all junctions across all hdf5 files to establish a joint coordinate system
collect_junction_db_step1_coordinates.py

step 2 - project the individual count files into the joint coordinate system
collect_junction_db_step2_project_counts.py

step 3 - gather the projected counts into a joint count file
collect_junction_db_step3_gather.py
